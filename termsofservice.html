                    <p class="text-stone-900 text-base font-normal ">3.1 Services. Fexo provides Services to its Customers, located
                        at its Website, fully described under an applicable "Order" (as defined under Section 3.4). Fexo will use
                        commercially reasonable efforts to make the Services on its Website available to the Customer, subject to
                        receipt of the applicable Fees (as detailed under an Order).<br><br>3.2 License to Fexo Services. Fexo
                        grants the Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, non-transferable, non-assignable right to
                        access and use the Website for the Term (as defined under Section 8.1), solely for internal business
                        purposes and in compliance with any additional limitations specified under an applicable Order.<br><br>3.3
                        On-Premise Deployment. If Customer accesses the Website through an on-premises deployment, the right to
                        access such service is limited to the time period mentioned in the applicable Order. Use of the Services
                        through such deployment is limited, non-exclusive, non-sub-licensable, non-transferable, and non-assignable.
                        Upon the lapse of the applicable Service duration, Customer must destroy and permanently delete all Fexo
                        data from their premises. Fexo retains the right to inspect and audit customer's servers for Fexo usage data
                        and any violation of the limited license for one year after the lapse of the applicable Service duration.
                        Unauthorized consumption of additional licenses without prior payment constitutes a material breach,
                        remediable only by pro-rata payment to Fexo.<br><br>3.4 Order. For the purposes of this Agreement, an
                        "Order" is defined as an order form or other similar document (including but not limited to an online order
                        form) that details the Services being provided hereunder and the applicable Fees to be paid by the Customer
                        to Fexo. The Order may also provide details regarding the service level terms (if any). In the event of a
                        conflict between the Order and the Terms of Service, the Order will prevail.<br><br>3.5 Trials. If Customer
                        accesses the Service on a trial basis, use is limited to specified service levels, and the trial is provided
                        "as-is" without indemnification, support, or warranties.<br><br>3.6 No-Fee Access. If Customer uses the
                        Service on a no-fee basis (Limited Use), use is subject to specified service levels, and the Limited Use is
                        provided "as-is" without indemnification, support, or warranties.<br><br>3.7 Support Services. Fexo may
                        provide Support Services subject to additional Fees detailed in an applicable Order.<br><br>3.8 Service
                        Suspension. Fexo may suspend Customer's access to the Services for security reasons, insolvency, breach of
                        the Agreement, or failure to pay Fees.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="static-subheading">4. RESTRICTIONS &amp; RESERVATIONS</h2>
                    <p class="text-stone-900 text-base font-normal ">4.1 Restrictions. Customers agree to use the Services in
                        compliance with applicable laws, including data protection and privacy laws. Customers must not alter
                        proprietary notices, reverse engineer, or allow third-party access.<br><br>4.2 Reservation. The Services are
                        provided under license, and nothing grants ownership rights. Fexo and its licensors retain all rights,
                        title, and interest in the Services, except as expressly granted in this Agreement.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="static-subheading">5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h2>

                        other intellectual property created, used, provided, or made available by Fexo under or in connection with
                        the Services pursuant to this Agreement. Additionally, Fexo is the owner of the "Service Software" embedded
                        in the Services. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Service Software" encompasses any Fexo or third-party
                        software code, computer program, documentation, new versions, updates, enhancements, upgrades, revisions,
                        improvements, and modifications of the foregoing that Fexo has embedded into the Services. This proprietary
                        Service Software is owned by Fexo and is provided to the Customer under this Agreement. The Customer
                        acknowledges that Fexo holds all rights related to the Service Software. Subject to the terms and conditions
                        of this Agreement, including the receipt of all applicable fees, Fexo grants the Customer a limited,
                        non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable, and non-sub-licensable license to run such Service Software
                        solely as necessary to make use of the Services.<br><br>5.2 Restrictions. The Customer agrees not to: (a)
                        exceed the scope of the licenses granted in Section 5.1; (b) make copies of the Service Software; (c)
                        distribute, sublicense, assign, delegate, rent, lease, sell, time-share, or otherwise transfer the benefits
                        of, use under, or rights to the license granted in Section 3.2 and Section 5.1; (d) reverse engineer,
                        decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to learn the source code, structure, or algorithms underlying
                        the software, except to the extent required to be permitted under applicable law; (e) modify, translate, or
                        create derivative works of the Service Software; (f) remove any copyright, trademark, patent, or other
                        proprietary notice that appears on the Service Software or copies thereof; or (g) combine or distribute any
                        of the Service Software with any third-party software that is licensed under terms requiring the provision
                        of software (or any associated intellectual property rights) in source code form (e.g., as "open source"),
                        licensed to others to allow the creation or distribution of derivative works, or distributed without
                        charge.<br><br>5.3 Feedback. Customer may provide suggestions, comments, or other feedback to Fexo regarding
                        the Services ("Feedback"). Customer grants Fexo a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,
                        transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use and exploit the Feedback for any
                        purpose.<br><br>5.4 Disclaimer. Nothing in this Agreement will impair Fexo's right to develop, acquire,
                        license, market, promote, or distribute products, software, or technologies that perform the same or similar
                        functions as, or otherwise compete with any products, software, or technologies that the Customer may
                        develop, produce, market, or distribute.<br></p>
                    <h2 class="static-subheading">6. DATA PRIVACY</h2>
                    <p class="text-stone-900 text-base font-normal ">6.1 Fexo Privacy Policy. Fexo's current Privacy Policy is
                        accessible at the <a class="underline text-purple-800" rel="noopener noreferrer" hhref="#privacy" @click.prevent="activeTab = 'privacy'"
                            target="_blank">"Privacy Policy"</a> (the "Privacy Policy"), and it is incorporated herein by reference.
                        Please review the Privacy Policy to understand Fexo's information collection, usage, and disclosure
                        practices with respect to information collected through the Services.<br><br>6.2 Customer Data. Customer
                        Data is and shall remain the property of the Customer. For the purpose of this Agreement, "Customer Data"
                        refers to any data, information, or other material provided, uploaded, or submitted by the Customer to the
                        Service during the use of the Services. Customer, not Fexo, is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality,
                        integrity, legality, reliability, appropriateness, and intellectual property ownership or right to use all
                        Customer Data. Customer grants Fexo a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, worldwide,
                        royalty-free license to use, collect, transfer, and process the Customer Data solely for providing the
                        Services to the Customer under the terms of the applicable Order and this Agreement.<br><br>6.3 Derived
                        Data. Customer understands and acknowledges that Fexo may generate "Derived Data" from the Customer Data.
                        "Derived Data" refers to data submitted to, collected by, or generated by Fexo from the Customer Data in
                        connection with the Customer's use of the Services. Customer agrees that Fexo may use Derived Data for its
                        internal business purposes, including improving, testing, operating, promoting, and marketing Fexo's
                        products and services.<br><br>6.4 Customer Responsibility. Customer is solely responsible for Customer Data,
                        including but not limited to: (a) compliance with all applicable laws and this Agreement; (b) any claims
                        related to Customer Data; (c) any claims that Customer Data infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise
                        violates the rights of any third party; and (d) backing up and maintaining Customer Data.<br><br>6.5 GDPR
                        Reference. If Fexo processes Customer's "Personal Data" under this Agreement, and such Personal Data is
                        subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Customer may require Fexo to enter into a
                        Data Processing Agreement ("DPA"). Under such a DPA, Fexo shall be the data "Processor," and the Customer
                        shall be the data "Controller." The processing of Personal Data under this Agreement is subject to Fexo's
                        DPA. The Customer may request to enter into the Fexo DPA in reference to the Services by sending a request
                        to <span class="underline text-purple-800 cursor-pointer">hello@fexo.io</span>. All capitalized terms not
                        defined under this Section 6.5 shall have the same meaning as ascribed to them under Article 4 of
                        GDPR.<br><br>6.6 Fexo's Responsibility. Fexo will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
                        security and integrity of the Services and all Customer Data controlled by Fexo. Fexo is not responsible for
                        unauthorized access to Customer Data or the unauthorized use of the Services unless such access is directly
                        due to Fexo's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Customer is responsible for the use of the Services by
                        any person to whom Customer has given access, even if Customer did not authorize such use. Fexo reserves the
                        right to retain Customer Data for up to ninety (90) days following the termination or expiration of the

                            members educated on our policies. Detected security events are escalated to our emergency alias,
                            triggering prompt response and resolution. Post-event, a comprehensive post-mortem analysis is

                    <p class="text-stone-900 text-base font-normal ">2. Infrastructure</p><br>All Fexo services operate in the
                    cloud, with no proprietary routers, load balancers, DNS servers, or physical servers. Hosted on AWS, MS and
                    Google facilities, our services and data benefit from the security protocols of the respective cloud
                    infrastructure provider. The details are mentioned on the appropriate websites of AWS, MS and Google. Disaster
                    recovery considerations have been integral to our service architecture.<br><br>Our servers reside within a
                    dedicated virtual private cloud (VPC) with network access control lists (ACLs) preventing unauthorized access to
                    our internal network. Fexo employs backup solutions for datastores containing customer data.<br><br>3.
                    Data<br><br>All customer data is stored in India within multi-tenant datastores. While individual datastores per
                    customer are not maintained, robust privacy controls in our application code ensure data separation, with
                    regular unit and integration tests validating their effectiveness. The configuration and patching of systems
                    processing customer data align with industry-recognized hardening standards.<br><br>Certain subprocessors are

                    Transfer<br><br>All data transmitted to or from the Fexo Website is encrypted in transit using 256-bit
                    encryption. Our API and application endpoints operate exclusively on TLS/SSL, earning an "A+" rating on SSL
                    Labs' tests. Additionally, industry-standard AES-256 encryption secures data at rest.<br><br>5.
                    Authentication<br><br>Fexo is served entirely over HTTPS, with no corporate resources or additional privileges
                    from being on Fexo's network. Two-factor authentication (2FA) and robust password policies on AWS, MS and Google
                    enhance access protection to cloud services.<br><br>6. Permissions and Admin Controls<br><br>Fexo offers
                    configurable permission levels for employees to access the Fexo Website, covering app settings, billing, user

                    Information on AWS, MS and Google security certifications are accessible at their respective security
                    websites.<br><br>All payment instrument processing is handled by Stripe, adhering to their security practices as
